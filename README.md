# Face-Detection-and-Blurring
This project demonstrates how to use OpenCV and MTCNN to detect and blur faces in a video. The script reads an input video, processes each frame to identify faces, applies a Gaussian blur to the detected faces.

# Key Features:
- Utilizes MTCNN for robust face detection.
- Applies Gaussian blur to ensure privacy by obfuscating faces.
- Processes video frames efficiently using OpenCV.
